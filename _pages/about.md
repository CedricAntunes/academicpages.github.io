A bit about myself
======
I am an MSc candidate in Political Science at Fundação Getulio Vargas' Department of Economics (FGV-EESP & CEPESP). I concluded my Bachelor of Arts in political science and IR at FGV-RI in 2022 (*cum laude*). I have also attended the Department of Politics at Universidad Torcuato di Tella (Buenos Aires, Argentina - 2020) and the Department of Social Sciences at the University of Oslo (Oslo, Norway – 2021).

And a bit about my research interests
======
I am Program Assistant at [Evaluasi](https://www.evaluasi.io/team), a Texas based start-up focused on improving impact evaluation of corporate social responsibility efforts. Concurrent, I help to clean, wrangle and publicize Brazilian electoral data (from TSE) on [CepespData](https://cepespdata.io/): specifically, I am responsible for tracking down the coordinates of all polling stations in Brazil. I build Voronoi polygons (for fun and for living) and help to dissiminate data on the geography of Brazilian elections. I am also research assistant at Vanderbilt University's Department of Political Science.
